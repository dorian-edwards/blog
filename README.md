# Portfolio draft #1

This was my 3rd or 4th portfolio site that I decided to get somewhat fancier with and I just wanted to build a markdown blog using NextJS deployed on the Vercel hosting platform.

Turns out though, I was much more enamored with the building process rather than writing regularly ðŸ˜• so I scrapped the blog idea and decided to take my portfolio in another direction, sans blog.
