# Intro

Hello, I'm Dorian. Welcome to my blog! I am a licensed pharmacist and I love to code in my free time. I'm hoping to make the transition to full-time tech
by coding as much as a I can and building a note-worthy resume that will land me my first gig.

## Purpose

This blog will serve as a diary of sorts, a chronicling of my journey into tech. Hopefully it can also serve as a helpful resources to other professionals also
looking to transition to tech. As I flail about aimlessly, I hope to document my projects, my success, my failures, and most importatntly, what I've learned
from them all.
