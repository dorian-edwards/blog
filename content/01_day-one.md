## Intro

Hello, I'm Dorian. Welcome to my blog! I am a licensed pharmacist and I love to code in my free time. I'm hoping to make the transition to full-time tech
by coding as much as a I can and building a noteworthy resume that will land me my first gig.

## Purpose

This blog will serve as a diary of sorts, a chronicling of my journey into tech. Hopefully it can also serve as a helpful resource to other people also
looking to transition to tech. As I flail about aimlessly, I hope to document my projects, my successes, my failures, and most importantly, what I've learned
from them all.

## About Me

I'm a pharmacist by training, earning my PharmD from the [University of Maryland School of Pharmacy](https://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/) in Baltimore, MD and, prior to that, my B.A in African American Studies from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in College Park, MD.

I started as a CompSci major but wasn't the best student. Long story short, here I am several years later trying to get back to the career that I always wanted but never thought I could have.
